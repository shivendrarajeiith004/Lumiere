# Plan for Specification
- We apparently dont need to write the code and grammar here. So we will just work on language design an what we are trying to acheive here.
- We'll write it in latex mostly coz the Java Doc also seems very formal. 
- Remember sir wants us to write more than what we can do and finally settle for some mid ground. So well add as much as we can first.

We could call our DSL **Lumiere**
1. Intoduction to Lumiere
   1. `<Pitch herer>`
   2. Now Side headings
      1. Intent/Motivation and then Design Goals and Objective
   3. How is it different from the other DSLs
2. Lumiere
   1. Data types and Classes defined
   2. Operators
   3. Functions and their Outputs
   4. Difference from other DSLs
