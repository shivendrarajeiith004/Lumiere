Welcome To repository for Lumiere !!!

To see specifications regarding Lumiere:
	
Go To The Language/documentation Folder..
	
 	To execute The language Code For all the phases:
		To run the code: 
			1.'chmod +x build.sh'
			2.'./build.sh'
		To clean the code :	
			1.'chmod +x clean.sh'
			2.'./clean.sh'


To View source code for each of the Phases, You can see it in Language Folder:
	
 	1.Phase 1:
		Consists of Lexical Analysing For the language.It contains details about token used in the language
		1.To Run the Code for Phase 1
			a. Open terminal in 'src' directory for each phase.
			b. use 'make' command to compile the program.
			c. use 'make run' to execute the the program and the outputs will be present in 'test' directory.
			d. use 'make clean' to remove files after use.

	2.Phase 2-3:
		Consists of Parsing and syntax Checking For  the language.
		1. To Run the Code for Phase 2-3
			a. Open terminal in 'src' directory for each phase.
			b. use 'make' command to compile the program.
			c. use 'make run' to execute the the program and the outputs will be present in 'test' directory.
			d. use 'make clean' to remove files after use.
	3. Phase 4
		# To Run the Code
    **Note** : The code works perfectly fine on MacOs systems.
		1. Navigate to the project directory:
		    ```bash
		    cd Language/Phase4-Semantics
		    ```
		
		2. Build the project using the `build.sh` script:
